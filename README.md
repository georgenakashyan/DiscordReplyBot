# DiscordReplyBot

## Introduction

### Using the Discord API, the Discord Reply Bot does the following:
  * Scans all incoming messages to see if it matches a keyword.
  * If keyword is mentioned it has a chance of outputting a random reply from a list. 
  * The keyword, chance percentage, and list can all be changed with commands.

### Extra features:
  * Can also scan for individual people and have a chance to respond to their messages with their own custom list.
  * Admin list with user ID's so those people can use specific commands such as deleting quotes.
